# CMPUT-191-Assignment-3 - Wheat Pricing Index

# Task
Our task was to create a purchasing power parity index for a good of our choice. You can read about purchasing power parity here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity. We chose to creat an index for wheat pricing. We have decided that wheat pricing is important to analyze because it is a basic, yet essential good that we can use to compare any country of our choosing.

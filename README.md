# CMPUT-191-Assignment-3 - Flour Pricing Index

# Task
Our task was to create a purchasing power parity index for a good of our choice. You can read about purchasing power parity here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity. We chose to create an index for flour pricing. We have decided that flour pricing is important to analyze because it is a basic, yet essential good that we can use to compare any country of our choosing. 

# These are the steps that we took in order to create our wheat pricing index!

## 1. Importing pricing data on the flour product into a table from 'https://www.globalproductprices.com/rankings/flour_prices/'
Here we scraped out data from the source using beautiful soup and then cleaned the data into a table containing the countries and their prices per 1kg of flour.
